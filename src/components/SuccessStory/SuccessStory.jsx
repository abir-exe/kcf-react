                                We've been engaged in a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with BEACON Pharmaceutical, collaborating closely on the design of an oncology lab. This lab is intended for the production of finished fine chemicals used in the manufacturing of cancer drugs, specifically at the gram to kilo scale. Our dedicated team has successfully completed 80% of the design work, showcasing our commitment to delivering high-quality solutions for this critical endeavor. However, due to management decisions, the project is currently on hold. We remain ready and eager to resume and complete this important project whenever it aligns with BEACON Pharmaceutical's objectives and priorities.</p>
